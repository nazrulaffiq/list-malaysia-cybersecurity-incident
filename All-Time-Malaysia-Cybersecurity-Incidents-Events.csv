That’s our shorthand for the use of operating system features or legitimate network administration tools to compromise victims’ networks. The purpose of living off the land is twofold. By using such features and tools, attackers are hoping to blend in on the victim’s network and hide their activity in a sea of legitimate processes. Secondly, even if malicious activity involving these tools is detected, it can make it harder to attribute attacks. If everyone is using similar tools, it’s more difficult to distinguish one group from another. Most attack groups do still create and leverage custom malware, but it tends to be employed sparingly, reducing the risk of discovery."

This is something unusual for Delivery Services to persist users to provide their full NRIC numbers. The actual motive of such calls is unknown as of now. Nevertheless, there is a potential for misusing such personal details of users by irresponsible parties. This could be an attempt to gain personal information such as Identification Card (NRIC) numbers or other personal details for possible malicious purposes. Based on our observation, we presume the perpetrators are using a VoIP system to make the calls. Most likely they are using a group of call agents, with automatically assigned different phone numbers that can be easily interchanged within the VoIP phone number system, used to call the victims."
